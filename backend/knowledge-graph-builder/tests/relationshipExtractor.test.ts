// Placeholder for relationshipExtractor tests.
// In a real scenario, you would use a testing framework like Jest or Vitest.

// FIX: Re-enabled mock test functions to resolve TS errors in a non-test runner environment.
// These functions are typically provided globally by a test runner like Jest or Vitest.
